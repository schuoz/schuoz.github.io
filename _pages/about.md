👨🏻‍💻 I'm a PostDoc Researcher specializing in multi-source earth observation and machine learning for ecological and
biodiversity monitoring at ETH Zurich .

🔬 My research interests are in Biodiversity monitoring with remote sensing and machine learning!

📚 My PhD Thesis is "Biodiversity Monitoing 🌍 in large rivers with remote sensing 🛰️ and environmental DNA 🧬".

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **PostDoc Researcher** at the Ecosystems and Landscape Evolution group at ETH Zurich with Prof. Dr. Loïc Pellissier and Prof. Dr. Jan Dirk Wegner working on **Combining remote sensing and eDNA for large river biodiversity monitoring**.
Additionally, I have professional experience serving as a **Scientific Advisor** at Riverkin.
There I worked on provding remote sensing and biodiversity conservation expertise for building hydorlogical observtory network using Riverkin's highly integrated sensors.
